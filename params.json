The approach (WESSBAS) comprises three main components. First, a system and tool agnostic domain-specific language (DSL) allows the layered modeling of workload specifications of session-based systems. Second, instances of this DSL are automatically extracted from recorded session logs of production systems. Third, these instances are transformed into executable workload specifications of load generation tools and model-based performance evaluation tools. We present transformations to the common load testing tool Apache JMeter and to the Palladio Component Model.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nA. van Hoorn, M. Rohr, and W. Hasselbring.
